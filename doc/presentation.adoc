== Introduction

Adaptive vs. Responsive

=== Adaptive
This is adaptive

=== Responsive
This is responsive

== Concerns

* Various screen sizes
** Layout changes
* Navigation
** Deep linking
* Plugin support
* Differing renderers

== Tools

There are many...

=== API Classes

* LayoutBuilder
* MediaQuery
* Expanded
* Flexible
* FittedBox
* SizedBox

=== PubDev Packages

* responsive_framework
* flutter_screenutil
* boxy
* responsive_grid_list
* responsive_ui

Use search terms _adaptive_ or _responsive_ for many more



== Testing
* Chrome Developer Tool
* Desktop Version

== Progressive Web Application (PWA)
* Offline Support
* Installable
* Push Notifications
* Easy Synchronization

== Example Layout Changes
* Master-details (inline vs different page)
* Single Column vs grid view

== Gotchas
* Use MediaQuery cautiously

== Some Source Code

This is what I want to show.
